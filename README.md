# Stock Talk

Investors are constantly looking for indicators that can predict trends in the financial markets. Recently I became curious whether mentions on social media might have any correlation with share price. I picked a set of retail companies whose Twitter mentions seemed to reflect the attitudes of customers (as opposed to financial commentators) and compared their quantity to the day's closing price.

The site was created with Rails, Bootstrap, and Dygraphs, with price data from Yahoo! Finance. It's currently deployed [here](http://stocktalk.herokuapp.com)
